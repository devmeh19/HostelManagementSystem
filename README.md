# HostelManagementSystem

A C++ console application demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to efficiently manage hostel operations — from student registration to room assignment and record maintenance.


## Overview

This program implements a hostel management system using OOP concepts in C++. It enables operations such as:

- Student registration
- Room allocation
- Viewing/searching student and room details
- Deletion of records

All functionality is built around modular classes representing key entities like Student, Room, Hosteller, and the overarching Management System.

## Features

- **Add** new students or rooms  
- **Allocate** rooms to students  
- **Search** for student or room by ID  
- **View** all existing records (students and rooms)  
- **Delete** records  
- **Simple console-based menu interface**

## Technologies

- **Language:** C++ (compatible with C++11 or later)  
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Build & Test:** g++, clang++, or any C++-supporting IDE (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion, etc.)

Usage
Once executed, the console menu appears. You can typically perform:

Add Student

Add Room

Allocate Room

Search Student by ID

Search Room by ID

View All Records

Delete Student or Room

Exit

Respond with the number corresponding to your desired action and follow the prompts.

Architecture & Design
The project likely employs OOP with entities such as:

Student — stores student-specific details (e.g., ID, name, department)

Room — encapsulates room attributes (e.g., room number, capacity)

Hosteller or Allocation — potentially manages relationships between students and rooms

ManagementSystem — central class coordinating operations like adding, deleting, searching, and listing records

Each class probably contains attributes, constructors, and methods to manage its internal data, reflecting standard OOP practices (encapsulation, modularity).

Extending the Project
To enhance the system:

File I/O: Persist data using file streams

Data Structures: Manage records with std::vector, std::map, or smart pointers (std::unique_ptr)

Validation: Ensure correct inputs (e.g., unique IDs, capacity checks)

UI: Introduce colors or clear the console between actions

Persistence: Use databases or JSON/XML serialization for long-term storage
